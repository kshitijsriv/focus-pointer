# Focus Pointer

**Focus Pointer** is a minimalist web-based tool designed to help users enhance their focus and concentration. The webpage provides a central focal point and features a timer and subtle visual cues to guide and support users during focused work sessions.

## Features

- **Single-Point Focus Exercise**:
  A simple red dot appears in the center of the screen, encouraging users to focus their attention.

- **Timer and Controls**:
  - A timer is displayed in the top-right corner to track the duration of each focus session.
  - Users can start and stop the session using a dedicated button.

- **Subtle Visual Cues**:
  - Every 30 seconds, the focal point provides a minimal visual cue (e.g., a brief color change and size pulse) to gently remind users of the passage of time without breaking their focus.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage in any modern browser.
2. Click the "Start Focus Session" button to begin.
3. Concentrate on the red focal point in the center of the screen.
4. Observe the timer in the top-right corner to track your session duration.
5. Every 30 seconds, a subtle visual cue will appear on the focal point to help maintain awareness and focus.
6. Click "End Focus Session" to reset the session.
